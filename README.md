This was my solution for the learn.microsoft training unit 4 of 7: Exercise - Complete a challenge activity to apply business rules 

found at: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/csharp-if-elseif-else/4-challenge

I really liked this one because the examples in unit 3 as well as the challenge in unit 4 not only show how to provide flow control by properly nesting and/or arranging if, else if, and/or else structures to add 
logic/logical decision making to (console, donet style)applications in the C# language in VSC. They also show two pretty neat practical applications(in the conceptual sense) of this fundamental pilar of 
programming-logic that is the extra mile above and beyond those typically associated with said pilar: Guess the secret word/number, input/output automation-e.g. player[x] highscore=? 1-1000, if yes-then no, etc
The example in unit 4 demonstrates how to provide the underlying logic-code that I can tie to a GUI later for a craps game for those interested in online casino software development! 
The challenge provided the opportunity to learn how to properly modularize the code (can't say methods since this is flow contorl here) such that the discount-percentage of which is based on 
the number of days remaining in a subscription is operated on inside of its own, nested if-else structure and then output appropriatley per the conditions using 
an if-else if-else structure to evaluate for the one of four conditions of which properly corresponds to the one of four number-sets of daysUntilExpiration remaining and outputs the results using the 
Console.WriteLine() method combined with string interpolation. 

This technique was a good refresher on the true difference between Object-Oriented vs. Procedural programming. I left my procedural style code in the if-else if-else structures evaluating the 
conditions and commented them out. I was using that first until I realized by reviewing unit three that while my code did not need protection that it was not, in fact, very modular. There's something 
else I can't put my finger on yet...
You can modularize without the need for restricting access or that of OOP? You can also modularize without methods?!
